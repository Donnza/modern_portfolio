terminal
    "mkdir project_name"
    "cd project_name"
    "code ."        open project in VScode
create dist folder
    folder incl files such as html, css, js, etc
create index.html file in dist folder
    type ! and enter tab to autocomplete HTML file
create scss folder
    work on sass workflow
    incl sass files
create main.scss file
    main sass file 
    every other sass file will be partials that we import into this file
node-sass
    need a way for our sass to be compiled into regular css because the browser doesnt read scss
    uses LibSass, the C version of the popular stylesheet preprocessor, very fast
    use npm to install node-sass => "npm install node-sass"
    before we install; need to create a package.json file; which is like a manifest for our project

    open terminal (ctrl + `); type "npm init"; follow steps
    anything installed throught npm will be put in the package.json file

    type "npm i node-sass" to install
        i = install;

Sass setup
    uses npm script 
    TEST
        change "test" script in package.json file
        from:   "scripts": {
                    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
                }

        to:     "sass": "echo \"Hello from sass script\""
        To run script open terminal type "npm run sass"

    "sass": "node-sass -w scss/ -o dist/css/ --recursive"
        node-sass       run node-sass
        -w scss/        watch the scss folder
        -o dist/css     output the compiled css file to dist/css/ (dont have to create dist/css/ folder) 
        --recursive     will have issues with partials and auto reload without recursive flag
    Terminal: npm run sass

main.sccs
    $primary-colour
        variables start with $
    dont touch main.css file that sass created
        work with main.scss file for styling with css
    Incl compiled version (main.css not main.scss) in the index.html file
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/main.css">

git repository
    open new terminal (+) and keep the npm terminal open
    create a file called .gitignore 
        touch .gitignore
            touch command creates a file
        windows powershell use "ni .gitignore"
            new-item .gitignore
    add "node-modules" to .gitignore file
        tells git to ignore node-modules folder
            no need to alter folder or upload to git
                node dependencies
    init git repository
        terminal: git init
            creates hidden .git folder
    git add .
        add . => add all files (. => all)
